# About

Harsh environmental conditions cultivated by inadequate practices has resulted in inefficient farming. Harsh environments like the Middle east have been degraded by climate change has resulting in scarce goods. Farmers can not afford to use out-dated methods such as trial-and-error as lost opportunities are costly and detrimental to societal growth. A pragmatic and accessible solution is required to monitor fluctuations and give real-time research-backed solutions.

# Goals

## 📈 Monitoring

### 🧪 Harmful chemicals

A significant trend of smoking has caused harm to many water sources leading to different crops used daily by the iranian population. Providing insights to these chemicals stand as one of the key motives of this project.

### 💧 Wind, water, air

Monitoring wind, water, and air are amongst the most important contributors to this cause providing key details as where strategical locations for specifics plants may be.

## 🎥 Video

Video monitoring can also be a key insight for farmers, providing easy decision making.

### ☀️ Sun light

The growth of plants heavily rely on adaquate sunlight. Monitoring exact sunlight levels and changes during hours of the day, by using both gathered data and trends aswell as weather trends can lead farmers to make the best decisions in a split second!

## 🧑‍🔬 Patterns and Predictions

### 🌪 Fire, Floods, and Derecho

Early detection systems can be cruical for farmers.

## Phases

### (Phase 1 (Light))[https://github.com/k1nxx/shambalile/wiki/Phase-1-Analysis]

Light can be one of the most contributing factors in a plants growth, reliant on a multitude of parameters.
